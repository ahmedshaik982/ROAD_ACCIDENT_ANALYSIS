The dashboard provides insights into various factors contributing to accidents, assisting in understanding patterns and trends.

Below is a summary of the process I followed and the visualizations included in the dashboard.

Process:
1. Imported the raw data
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data
3. Created visualizations using the processed data
4. Developed additional measures and columns to support visualizations

Visualizations:
1. Accidents by Hour of Day
2. Accident Severity by Road Type
3. Number of Casualties by Vehicle Type
4. Accidents by Weather Conditions
5. Number of Vehicles Involved in Accidents
6. Number of Accidents by Day of the Week
7. Number of Accidents by Light Conditions
8. Number of Accidents by Speed Limit

Slicers:
1. Month
2. Year

These slicers allow users to filter the data and focus on specific time periods for a more detailed analysis.
